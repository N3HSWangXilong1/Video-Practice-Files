# Video-Practice-Files

Here is a list of files that students will use on Thursday and Friday, June 16 and 17, 2022, to practice editing videos in ShotCut.

Credits: I own the rights to all of the video clips. I took the pictures on various vacations in China, Japan, Thailand, Indonesia, and the US.
I also own the photographs. The memes are collected from various sources over the years, from the internet and facebook, and are included under
Educational Fair use.

"The Immigrant Song" belongs to Led Zeppelin and is also included under Educational Fair Use.
